title: "Google Indexing"
status: running
---

Hypothesis
--------

Setting up journal.skorulis.com with a link pointing to it from both the base skorulis.com page as well as from github will be indexed in a fairly short amount of time (< 1 week). Meanwhile the experiments subdomain will not be picked up as it does not have any references

Method
------

Create both web pages and check google daily until they are indexed.

Results
------

* http://journal.skorulis.com showed up on google on Monday 10th July. 3 days was slightly quicker than I expected actually.
