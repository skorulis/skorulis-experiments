title: "Organic Shirt Sales"

Background
-------

Thinking about seeing how I go selling t-shirts. 

Hypothesis
--------

Simply putting up a number of t-shirt designs without advertising will not result in a decent amount of sales.

Method
------

Create at least 10 shirt designs and spread them across multiple sites. Record the number of sales without introducing advertising.
